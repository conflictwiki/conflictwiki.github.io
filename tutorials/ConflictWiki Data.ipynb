    "We introduce the ConflictWiki dataset, a large collection of [Wikipedia articles on armed conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Conflicts) featuring full text accompanied by pre-computed meaningful Longformer representations of the text on the document- and section-level. \n",
    "Each conflict is annotated with starting and end date, location, casualty counts, group strengths and conflict outcome. \n",
    "If provided on Wikipedia, entity articles feature auxiliary tabular information on languages, religion, ISO2 code and ideology. \n",

    "## Data Directory Structure\n",

    "The data directory contains three subdirectory, `conflict`, `entity` and `mappings`. \n",
    "`conflict` contains conflict-related data and information.\n",
    "`entity` contains entity-related data and information.\n",
    "`mappings` contains the conflict-entity and entity-entity relationships. \n",
    "If there are multiple files in a directory, they all contain the same content.\n",
